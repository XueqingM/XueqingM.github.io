Photochromic molecules as sensing component have the advantage of providing more recognition sites and sensing information. Based on photoswitchable naphthopyrans (NP), we developed a photoactive GSH nanosenor and a probe for induction of intracellular reductive stress. The principle of the GSH nanosenor is shown in Figure 1a. Photoswitch-mediated fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) strongly occurs between open-form NP and signal fluorophores inside the nanoparticle. The nucleophilic GSH selectively undergo Michael addition reaction with open-form NP and results in fluorescence turn-on upon UV irradiation. This nanosensor has reversible response to GSH with 0-1 mM concentration range. The response to GSH was found to be highly selective over a range of ROS, RNS, RSS, and common biological anions.

Exhausting intracellular GSH produces excessively reducing environments resulting in disruption of redox homeostasis. According to the reaction between NP and GSH, we further designed a photoactivatable probe that induce intracellular reductive stress. The fluorescence of the probe was enhanced 3.5 times after reacted with GSH. Incubated the probe and dihydroethidium with RAW 264.7 cell. The fluorescence of nucleus (ΔF) increased by 53-92% after UV irradiation. This enhancement of fluorescence results from the formation of dihydroethidium oxide. Proved that photo-activation of the probe will lead to rise of reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. These effects could be induced in single cells with minimal disturbance of neighboring cells.

Photoswitchable hemithioindigos (HTI) have advantage of absorbing in the visible region of the spectrum in both isomeric states, which makes them attractive for applications not tolerant of high-energy UV light. We designed fluorescent HTIs where the metastable E isomers could be arrested by protons through intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Therefore, the E isomer was much more basic than the Z isomer, which enabled photoactivated colorimetric and fluorescent pH response in solvents and polypropylene films. The HTIs also exhibited reversibly switchable fluorescence where the Z isomers were much more fluorescent than the E isomers and the protonated forms (ZH+ and EH+). The HTIs were proved lysosomotropic and remained photoswitchable in live cells. The temporal fluorescence evolution upon visible light stimulation allowed the differentiation of subcellular regions with different pH.

A pH-independent sensing principle based on nanospheres with ionophores was established. The nanospheres take advantage of aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ). The sensing principle was evaluated on ionophores for K+, Na+, Ca2+, Cu2+, and Pb2+, and could potentially be extended to other ionophores. Increasing target ion concentration in the solution of ACQ-based nanospheres resulting in turn-on fluorescence responses.

Taking advantage of the temperature-dependent thermal relaxation from the ring-closed to the ring-opened forms of photoacids (PAs), a fluorescent temperature sensor was developed. The logarithmic lifetime (lns) of the ring-closed spiro-form exhibited an excellent linear response to the reciprocal of the temperature. In addition, the fluorescent ring-opened PAs were able to highlight lysosomes and responded to lysosomal pH changes. These properties made the PAs promising fluorescent probes in the sensing of subcellular pH and temperature.
